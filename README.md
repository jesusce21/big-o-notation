# Big O notation:
Big O notation is a way of expressing the upper bound or worst-case complexity of an algorithm. It is commonly used in computer science to describe how the runtime or memory requirements of an algorithm scale with the size of the input data.

# Search Algorithms:

## Linear Search
![Linear Search](https://skilled.dev/images/linear-search.gif)

Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list or array until a match is found or the end of the list is reached.


## Binary Search

Binary search is a search algorithm that is used to find a specific element in a sorted list or array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is found or it is determined that the element is not in the list.

# Sort Algorithms:

## Bubble Sort
![Bubble Sort](https://i.makeagif.com/media/11-24-2015/gI3nus.gif)

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list or array to be sorted, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 


## Selection sort

Selection sort is another simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list or array and moving it to the beginning of the list or array. The algorithm maintains two sub-lists in the given list or array, one sorted and one unsorted.


## Insertion sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It works by iterating through an array of values, comparing each value to its adjacent values, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. 


## Merge sort

Merge Sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm that works by breaking down an array into smaller sub-arrays, sorting those sub-arrays, and then merging them back together to form a sorted array. 

## Quick sort

Quick Sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm that works by partitioning an array into two sub-arrays, one containing elements smaller than a chosen pivot and the other containing elements larger than the pivot. The pivot is then placed in its final position in the sorted array, and the same process is applied recursively to the sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted
